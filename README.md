#### Ambari Stack Services 
Stacks wrap services of all shapes and sizes with a consistent definition and lifecycle-control layer. With this wrapper in-place, Ambari can rationalize operations over a broad set of services.
To the Hadoop operator, this means that regardless of differences across services (e.g.install/start/stop/configure/status) each service can be managed and monitored with a consistent approach.
This also provides a natural extension point for operators and the community to create their own custom stack definitions to “plug-in” new services that can co-exist with Hadoop
Documentation on stacks/services can be found [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Stacks+and+Services)

##### Developer FAQ:

- How to enable debug logging?

In /etc/ambari-agent/conf/ambari-agent.ini set loglevel=DEBUG and run ‘service ambari-agent restart'

- How to test your service outside of Ambari?

After enabling debugging you can see the full command that Ambari invokes for each of the INSTALL, START, STOP operations for your service which can be run from the command line e.g.  
While you are installing service via wizard the below will give the full commands to invoke master.py:
```
ps -ef | grep <servicename>
```

e.g.
```
/usr/bin/python2.6 /var/lib/ambari-agent/cache/stacks/HDP/2.3/services/zeppelin-stack/package/scripts/master.py INSTALL /var/lib/ambari-agent/data/command-2502.json /var/lib/ambari-agent/cache/stacks/HDP/2.3/services/zeppelin-stack/package /var/lib/ambari-agent/data/structured-out-2502.json INFO /var/lib/ambari-agent/data/tmp
```

- In case service install fails, how to delete/unregister it from Ambari?

You will have to manually remove any artifacts created by service. To unregister the service from Ambari, see example here: https://github.com/hortonworks-gallery/ambari-zeppelin-service#remove-zeppelin-service

#### Ambari Views

Views Customizing the Interaction Experience for Operators and Users
Ambari Views will enable the community and operators to develop new ways to visualize operations, troubleshoot issues and interact with Hadoop. They will provide a framework to offer those experiences to specific sets of users. Via the pluggable UI framework, operators will be able to control which users get certain capabilities and to customize how those users interact with Hadoop.
Documentation on Ambari views can be found [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Views)

#### Ambari Blueprints/APIs

Ambari Blueprints deliver the below benefits:
A repeatable model for cluster provisioning (for consistency);
A method to automate cluster provisioning (for ad hoc cluster creation, whether bare metal or cloud);
A portable and cohesive definition of a cluster (for sharing best practices on component layout and configuration).
